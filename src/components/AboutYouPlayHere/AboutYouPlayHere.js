                <p>The project features an installation composed of an analogue map, made interactive with the use of an Augmented Reality (AR) application. This multifaceted project consists of a customized map of New York City’s public spaces where three different immigrant communities gather to collectively play a sport. The interactive aspect of the project is done between miniature models of these public spaces, and an augmented reality software called Aurasma, which includes documentary videos that appear on a smart device while navigating the map. The videos showcase three groups of immigrants in the United States, specifically New York City, highlighting their recreational activities, and how these activities connect to their immigration experience.</p>
                <p>Concerned with concepts related to migration, I created You Play Here in order to fully explore one question: is playing a sport in a public space working to create community and camaraderie amongst immigrant groups?</p>
                <h3>MY MISSION</h3>
                <p>I grew up in Argentina, around people who passionately view sports, especially soccer, as a religion -- a religion they believe and respect -- and who in turn value the social bonds that are created by playing sports.</p>
                <p>This globalized world will always have immigrants, and will always have sports, and society will always try to find common spaces to socialize and bond. I am unsure about the future of the public space, there is great value in the public, open for all space. Especially for the migrant, who could be low on resources if they have just arrived to a new city, or for the migrant who doesn’t have a social environment as a new arrived, and wants to meet people and their best chance is doing it “just by taking a stroll.” I hope to give this project the platform and attention it deserves so that many people can see it and resonate with its themes, as I personally have.</p>
